# VSCode for C Example

With VSCode LCov installed, the unit tests should run automatically when any C or CPP files change. 

Currently using VSCode LCov version 1.10, since 2.0 does not seem to work on Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa

## VSCode LCov Commands
CTRL-T - Show Coverage Report
CTRL-T - Enable Watchers

## Running tests
make tests && make cover && make report

## Running main
make main
